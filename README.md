## ðŸ’¡Inspiration
Every year around 1200 new small businesses get started. But, marketing strategy and advertising can cause small businesses a number of problems. As it is expensive they could not invest a big sum of money to build their own websites. The internet provides opportunities to find customers without Investing a lot in sense of Money, but many small businesses don't do enough with their online presence. A good marketing strategy will enable you to hit the target audience, to help them out with that, we have built a well-designed responsive Application - **Vyapaar Link, that will support small business owners with their marketing goals.

## âš™ What it does
It helps small businesses to increase their brand visibility. With the help of this Application, both business owners and customers get benefits. Customers can take selfies with the Shop along with the goods they will buy and then post a picture of it on the Platform in the form of NFT and can trade that as well. They can also give their feedback regarding the shop.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
- For Frontend and Graphics we use Next js, Tailwind CSS, Canva, Figma, and other designing tools.
- Used different libraries like DesoPy, DesoJS
- For the Backend, we use Flask to store all the content and updated it in real-time and Deso Protocol for Minting pics on Deso Blockchain.
- It is our first time working with NextJs and it was worth it to try it out, even though it wasn't easy to use it. but we were all really interested in learning - so this weekend, we committed to it!

## ðŸ’ªChallenges we ran into

- It is my first time building a decentralized Dapp on Deso. At first, we planned to add some great features like earning coins by minting pics, But we are unable to do so due to lack of time.
- In my team, most of the hackers are first-time hacking so we learn more about GitHub and hosting on GitHub pages, as well as first-time work with CockroachDB.
- We had a difficult time implementing the text overlay on the image as well, and it was hard to make a fully responsive UI.


## ðŸ“Œ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Well, we built a whole social platform in 7 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
- Able to build the app on Deso that really solves the issue.
- Ourself for trying our best.

## ðŸ“š What we learned
- Learned more about Deso, CochroachDB, and GitHub.  Learned a lot more about Tailwind CSS and responsive designs.

##ðŸ“š What's next for later
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and UX improvements!
- Making the code Open Source and engaging different People.
